Working on OpenCV projects with Deep Learning Applications

Hi folks, 

Those who need remaining OpenCV project videos, go through the below playlist link:

## In order to do object recognition/detection with cascade files, you first need cascade files.
## Cascade files link: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
 

#### what Is HaarCascade Classifier ?
So Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source. 
also The Haar Cascade is trained by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images. The training is generally done on a server and on various stages. 
Better results are obtained by using high quality images and increasing the amount of stages for which the classifier is trainer.


### detecMultiScale() function is for detecting objects if it finds a face in the image it will return in the form of x,y,w,h. and it needs some parameters.

#### ScaleFactor: This is parameter is for specifying  how much the image size is reduced at each image scale.

#### minNeighbors: Parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it, this parameter will affect the quality of the detected faces.
